#' Bro conn-log connection state values and descriptions
#'
#' Quick ref:
#'
#' \preformatted{
#'     S0  Connection attempt seen, no reply.
#'     S1  Connection established, not terminated.
#'     SF  Normal establishment and termination. Note that this is the
#'         same symbol as for state S1. You can tell the two apart because
#'         for S1 there will not be any byte counts in the summary, while
#'         for SF there will be.
#'    REJ  Connection attempt rejected.
#'     S2  Connection established and close attempt by originator seen
#'         (but no reply from responder).
#'     S3  Connection established and close attempt by responder seen
#'         (but no reply from originator).
#'   RSTO  Connection established, originator aborted (sent a RST).
#'   RSTR  Responder sent a RST.
#' RSTOS0  Originator sent a SYN followed by a RST, we never saw a
#'         SYN-ACK from the responder.
#'  RSTRH  Responder sent a SYN ACK followed by a RST, we never saw a SYN
#'         from the (purported) originator.
#'     SH  Originator sent a SYN followed by a FIN, we never saw a SYN ACK
#'         from the responder (hence the connection was “half” open).
#'    SHR Responder sent a SYN ACK followed by a FIN, we never saw a SYN
#'        from the originator.
#'    OTH No SYN seen, just midstream traffic (a “partial connection” that
#'        was not later closed).
