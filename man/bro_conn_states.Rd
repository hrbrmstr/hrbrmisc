    S0  Connection attempt seen, no reply.
    S1  Connection established, not terminated.
    SF  Normal establishment and termination. Note that this is the
        same symbol as for state S1. You can tell the two apart because
        for S1 there will not be any byte counts in the summary, while
        for SF there will be.
   REJ  Connection attempt rejected.
    S2  Connection established and close attempt by originator seen
        (but no reply from responder).
    S3  Connection established and close attempt by responder seen
        (but no reply from originator).
  RSTO  Connection established, originator aborted (sent a RST).
  RSTR  Responder sent a RST.
RSTOS0  Originator sent a SYN followed by a RST, we never saw a
        SYN-ACK from the responder.
 RSTRH  Responder sent a SYN ACK followed by a RST, we never saw a SYN
        from the (purported) originator.
    SH  Originator sent a SYN followed by a FIN, we never saw a SYN ACK
        from the responder (hence the connection was “half” open).
   SHR Responder sent a SYN ACK followed by a FIN, we never saw a SYN
       from the originator.
   OTH No SYN seen, just midstream traffic (a “partial connection” that
       was not later closed).
